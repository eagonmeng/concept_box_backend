# response:

Of course. This is an excellent project for demonstrating the power and elegance of the concept design methodology, particularly the role of synchronizations.

### App Idea

1. **Authenticated File Sharing ("ConceptBox")**: This is your suggestion, and it's a very strong candidate.
   * **Concepts**: `UserAuthentication`, `Sessioning`, `FileStorage`, `Sharing`.
   * **Interesting Syncs**:
     * **Composite Request**: A user logs in (`UserAuthentication.login`), which upon success triggers the creation of a session (`Sessioning.create`).
     * **Authorization Join**: To share a file, a sync must join state from three concepts: verify the requester's session (`Sessioning`), confirm they own the file (`FileStorage`), and find the user they want to share with by username (`UserAuthentication`).
     * **Mimicked Passthrough**: A request to `/files/upload` with a valid session directly triggers `FileStorage.upload`.

### App: ConceptBox

The **Authenticated File Sharing** app is the ideal choice. It's universally understood, inherently requires authentication and authorization, and provides a natural and compelling scenario for a multi-concept join in a `where` clause.

Here are the complete specifications for the "ConceptBox" concepts.
