# Including and Excluding Passthrough Routes

Allowing passthrough routes is a natural default that says, "anyone can freely access my concepts". This may be appropriate for entirely public-facing applications and internal tools that operate within secure boundaries. However, if at any point you would like (or need) to add one more layer of indirection for any of these example purposes:

* Auth: authenticating/authorizing *requests* before allowing parties to do what they want
* Reacting: more than one concept action needs to react to a *request*
* Logging: all behavior from one endpoint should be tracked

then what you need is to **reify requests**. This is the purpose of the Requesting concept: to allow parties to formulate requests that require a response. In other words, we are preventing parties from directly interacting with concepts and giving them the opportunity to form a tangible request instead.

By default, all concepts and their actions/queries will automatically be discovered, and registered as **unverified routes**. You will see a log of these when you first start the server through `deno run start`.

**Configuring Passthrough**

1. Open [passthrough.ts](passthrough.ts) to configure passthrough.
2. For every passthrough route you think makes sense and should be **included**, add it to `const inclusions = {...}` as a key/value pair `"route": "justification"`. For example, you might have `"/api/LikertSurvey/_getSurveyQuestions": "this is a public query"`
3. For every passthrough route you think should be **excluded**, simply add the route to `const exclusions = [...]`, such as `"/api/LikertSurvey/createSurvey"`
