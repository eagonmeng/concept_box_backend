# Dockerfile

I'd like to deploy this application using a Dockerfile. Deno suggests a basic skeleton as they have an official docker image:

```
FROM denoland/deno:latest

# Create working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy source
COPY . .

# Compile the main app
RUN deno cache main.ts

# Run the app
CMD ["deno", "run", "--allow-net", "main.ts"]
```
