# Requesting

The Requesting concept offers a traditional entrypoint to an application built with concepts and synchronizations in the form of an API request server. By entirely encapsulating HTTP, routing, and the concerns related to setting up a server, you can simply include the Requesting concept as part of your application and immediately begin programming against any HTTP requests made to your application:

**Setup**

1. Include the `Requesting` source folder as `src/concepts/Requesting` (already done if you've forked/cloned this repository).
2. Configure any environment variables you'd like change by adding/editing in your `.env` file (port, timeout, etc.)
3. Run `deno run start`, and your server will be live!
