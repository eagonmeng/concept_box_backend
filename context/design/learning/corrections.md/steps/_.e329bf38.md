# Synchronizations

Great, now create the complete set of synchronizations that generates the app. For requests that are similar to passthrough routes, keep the path in the form of `/api/{Concept}/{action or query}` and using the base URL of `/api` for other paths as well. Start by defining the synchronization specifications, then create the implementation.
