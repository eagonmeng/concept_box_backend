# response:

You are absolutely right to point that out. That is a crucial and common error when writing synchronizations: mismatching the parameter names from the concept specification with the variable names used within the sync. A query for a `user` will never produce a binding for `owner` unless explicitly aliased.

Thank you for the correction. I have reviewed all the synchronizations with this specific issue in mind and corrected them for accuracy, consistency, and clarity. The corrected implementations below now properly handle the flow of variables between queries.
