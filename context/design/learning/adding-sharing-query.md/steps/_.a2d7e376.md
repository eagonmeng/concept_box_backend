# Creating an Example App

I'm teaching a class on specifically how to write synchronizations, and their interesting properties. I'd like to create an example app:

* Each concept is interesting on its own and could be widely used
* Example concepts: Sessioning, Authenticating, FileUploading, etc.
* All passthrough routes are to be excluded by default
* There are interesting synchronizations that show various properties:
  * Synchronizations that explicitly model the necessary passthrough routes
  * A "composite" request with a path that is more semantic, rather than pointing at a Concept.action
  * Maybe a synchronization with an interesting join between queries of multiple concepts in the `where`

I'm thinking some sort of authenticated file uploading app, that allows easy personal file storage and file sharing could be an potential candidate.
